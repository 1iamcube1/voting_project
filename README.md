# VOTING_PROJECT

## Description
`VOTING_PROJECT` is an online voting application designed to ensure transparency and security during the voting process. The project consists of:
- **Backend**: Built with Python, handling core logic and integrating with blockchain (using Truffle) to store and verify voting results.
- **Frontend**: A user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to interact with the system.

This project is suitable for organizations or communities that need a secure and transparent voting system.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**:
  - Python 3.x (possibly using Flask/FastAPI)
  - Truffle (for blockchain smart contracts)
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Dependencies**:
  - See the `requirements.txt` file for backend dependencies
  - npm/yarn (if the frontend uses Node.js)
